# Secure Remote Microsoft Graph MCP Servers using Azure API Management (Experimental)

![Diagram](mcp-client-authorization.gif)

Azure API Management acts as the [AI Gateway](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AI-Gateway) for MCP servers. 

This sample implements the latest [MCP Authorization specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization#2-10-third-party-authorization-flow). Then calls Microsoft Graph API in MCP tool.

This is a [sequence diagram](infra/app/apim-oauth/diagrams/diagrams.md) to understand the flow.

## Pre-reqs (sunrise)

- Update main.bicep parameters to conform to naming schema for project (see lines 18 through 43)
- Wipe out .azure if redeploying

* environmentName and location specifically
* crypto script and managed identity can be deleted after deployment

## Post deployment
-- apimGenCryptoValues and managed identity can be deleted afterwards

## Deploy Remote MCP Server to Azure

Run this [azd](https://aka.ms/azd) command to provision the api management service, web app(with code) and all other required Azure resources

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

### MCP Inspector

1. In a **new terminal window**, install and run MCP Inspector

    ```shell
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```

1. CTRL click to load the MCP Inspector web app from the URL displayed by the app (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:6274/#resources)
1. Set the transport type to `Streamable HTTP`
1. Set the URL to your running API Management Streamable HTTP endpoint displayed after `azd up` and **Connect** ![azd up result](azdup.PNG)
1. **List Tools**.
1. Click the `ShowUserProfile` tool and **Run Tool**. The tool will return your user profile.

### VS Code
1. Install latest [VS Code Insider ](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)
1. Open Command Palette and trigger `MCP: Add Server` command
1. Select `HTTP` as MCP server type
1. Set the URL to your running API Management Streamable HTTP endpoint displayed after `azd up` and **Connect** ![azd up result](azdup.PNG)
1. Wait a while, VS Code Insider will ask you to login
1. Open GitHub Copilot and ask "Who am I?" in agent mode. GitHub Copilot will return your user profile obtained from this MCP server.
